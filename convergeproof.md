The **Central Limit Theorem** asserts that certain distributions will converge to a normal distrbution given a large enough sample size *N*. 
More specifically, the **De Moivre-Laplace Theorem** asserts that a normal and binomial distribution will be approximately identical given a sufficiently large *N*.

These theorems are demonstrated by the following figures, showing a binomial distrbution and a normal distribution of `N = 1000000` respectively.
