```{r}
library(tidyverse)
OurData <- read.csv("ClassData.csv")
head(OurData)
```

```{r}
OurData2 <- OurData %>%
  mutate(Slp = as.numeric(Sleep_Hrs)) %>%
  mutate(Phone_Hrs = as.numeric(Phone_Time))
head(OurData2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(OurData2, aes(x=Phone_Hrs, y=Slp))+geom_point()
```
There does not appear to be a linear relationship between phone hours and sleep hours.
```{r}
mean_calc <- function(x){
  return(mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}

bootstrapped_means <- replicate(10000, {
  bootstrapped_data <- sample(OurData2$Phone_Hrs, replace = TRUE)
  mean_calc(bootstrapped_data)  
})

quantile(bootstrapped_means, c(.05, .95))
```
With a 95% level of confidence, all UVA graduate students spend on an average of between 3.78 and 4.46 hours their phone per day.
