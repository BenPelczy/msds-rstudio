```{r}
library(tidyverse)
MarketData <- read.csv("WA_Marketing-Campaign.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(MarketData, aes(group=Promotion,x=Promotion,y=SalesInThousands, fill=Promotion)) + geom_boxplot()
```

The best analysis to answer the research question is the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

H0 : μ1 = μ2 = μ3 (Null Hypothesis: the Promotion population means are all equal)

HA : μ1 ≠ μ2 ∨ μ1 ≠ μ3 ∨ μ2 ≠ μ3 (Alternative Hypothesis: at least one Promotion population mean is different)

```{r}
anova<-aov(SalesInThousands~as.character(Promotion),data=MarketData)
summary(anova)
```
Given that the p-value = 6.77e-10 < 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis H0; the average sales amount is the not same across all three promotions.

Since the average sales are not equal, a post hoc test to investigate which promotion yields the most average sales would need to be done.
